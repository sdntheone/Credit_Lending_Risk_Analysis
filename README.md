# 💳 Credit Lending Risk Analysis

This project aims to analyze credit lending risk using machine learning techniques. It helps financial institutions determine whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan based on historical data.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a robust machine learning model that predicts the risk level of borrowers (low, medium, high), enabling informed decision-making in credit lending.
